# mint-panda Recipe App

This is project six from the Hack Weekly Discord.

Our team decided to use Vite + React + TypeScript for the frontend, and have it seperated from the backend.

## frontend

- `cd frontend`
- For Development: `npm run dev`
- For Deployment: `npm run build`

The folder `frontend/dist` is hosted here on [Github Pages](https://hack-weekly.github.io/mint-panda-recipe-app/)
